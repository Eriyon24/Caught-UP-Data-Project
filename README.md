# Caught Up Student Data Dashboard
This project was completed for Caught Up, a nonprofit focused on mentoring and empowering youth in Detroit. I analyzed student data to generate insights on school participation, grade-level distribution, transportation types, attendance trends, and program engagement.

Key visuals include:

Grade-level breakdowns

Transportation usage

Weekly attendance patterns

Return rate of participants

School representation

Group size frequencies by session

These charts were created using Smartsheet and used to inform program decisions.
