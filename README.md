# 📊 Caught Up Data Analysis Project

This project was created for [Caught Up](https://www.caughtup.org/), a nonprofit organization supporting youth mentorship and academic success in Detroit.

Using **Smartsheet’s AI-powered tools**, I analyzed and visualized program data to uncover insights related to student participation, transportation, attendance, and school representation.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Grade Levels**:  
  9th grade had the highest count (28 students), followed by 7th (19) and 11th (18).

- **Transportation**:  
  70% of students used both pick-up and drop-off services.

- **Attendance Days**:  
  Most entries occurred on **Monday (60%)** and **Wednesday (27%)**.

- **Engagement**:  
  58% of students were returning participants.

- **Group Size Trends**:  
  Most sessions had 1–3 attendees, with the highest frequency being solo attendees (179 sessions with one person).

  One school accounted for 42% of students, with the rest split among various Detroit-area schools.
